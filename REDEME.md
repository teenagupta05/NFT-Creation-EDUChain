# NFT Creation

## 📝 Project Description

**NFT Creation** is a blockchain-based application that allows users to mint and manage Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using a fully custom smart contract written in Solidity. The contract provides basic functionality to create unique digital assets without relying on external libraries like OpenZeppelin.

## 🌟 Project Vision

The project's goal is to offer a simple and educational smart contract for NFT minting, where all functionalities are hand-coded. This allows full transparency, customization, and a deeper understanding of how NFT standards work under the hood.

## 🔑 Key Features

- ✅ **ERC-721 Standard (Custom)**: Implements a simplified version of the ERC-721 NFT standard.
- 🖼️ **Metadata Support**: Each NFT can store its metadata via URI.
- 🛡️ **Owner-Controlled Minting**: Only the contract deployer can mint new NFTs.
- 📊 **Track Total Supply**: Keeps count of how many NFTs have been minted.
- 🧱 **No External Dependencies**: Lightweight and minimal — no OpenZeppelin used.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- 🌐 Build a user-friendly front-end interface for minting and managing NFTs.
- 🔓 Add public minting with access control (like whitelisting or payments).
- 📦 Integrate with IPFS for decentralized metadata storage.
- 🎨 Add traits and attributes to NFTs for gaming or collectibles.
- 🛒 Support secondary sales and royalties.
